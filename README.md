# Generating Elliptic Curves by Rank using GANS

This project uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to try to produce coefficients of elliptic curves by rank.  Specifically, these files attempt to produce rank one curves.  

To use these files, start with the training notebook and follow instructions.  Then go to the model evaluation notebook to evaluate any models that you train.
